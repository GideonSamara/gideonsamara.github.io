            <p>I was born in Toronto, Ontario and moved to Los Angeles, California with my family when I turned 9.
                <br>

                I am currently 23 years-old and have developed an addiction to traveling and exploring new cultures.
                <br>

                My boyfriend Chris is my absolute best friend. We do everything together, from homework to travel.
                <br>
            
            </p>


             <p>My ethnic background is Middle Eastern, specifically Lebanese. I speak arabic, but can't read or write it.
                <br>

                I have a degree in Biology from UCLA and am currently studying for a career change, hopefully into web
                development.
                <br>

                My original plan was to become a doctor and potentially save lives; however, after my internship, I
                changed my mind.
                <br>

            </p>
            

            <p>Currently, I run two business. A luxury hair care line, and a Life Insurance Agency.
                <br>

                Both of these jobs are very rewarding in different ways. I love helping people, and I get
                <br>

                to do so with beauty and finances. These ventures are both very recent for me, but I love
                <br>

                both these opportunities endlessly.
                <br>

            </p>

            <p> Thanks for checking out my Bio! If you want to chat or reach out to me, contact me above.</p>
